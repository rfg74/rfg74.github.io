# Lab 1:

## Part A:

Step 1 consisted ofinstalling the Arduino IDE and following through the preliminary setup instructions to install and calibrate all the necessary components. Step 2 was used to test whether the Artemis board was connected properly. To accomplish this, I ran the Example Blink. This caused the LED on the Artemis board to blink on and off which ensured that it was properly connected.
