# Lab 1:

## Part A:

Step 1 consisted of installing the Arduino IDE and following through the preliminary setup instructions to install and calibrate all the necessary components. Step 2 was used to test whether the Artemis board was connected properly. To accomplish this, I ran the Example Blink. This caused the LED on the Artemis board to blink on and off which ensured that it was properly connected.

Step 3 consisted of following Exammple Serial. This example allowed me to type in a character input and then in turn recieve those same characters as an output in the Serial monitor.

Step 4 tested the temperature sensor using the Example2_analogRead. As you can see below, pressing on the sensor, effectively warming it up, causes the temperature in the Serial monitor to slowly increase.
